# pyzmq-playground

A tiny playground to experiment with **ZeroMQ pub/sub**, orchestration, and event-driven microservices

---

## What is this?

This project is a simple example of a **reactive distributed system**:
- **Orchestrator:** Starts and supervises the services.
- **Detector:** Pretends to be a sensor or TinyML module ‚Äî publishes `object_detected` events at random.
- **Reactor:** Subscribes to the Detector‚Äôs events and reacts when something is actually detected.

It‚Äôs minimal on purpose ‚Äî so you can understand:
- How **ZeroMQ PUB/SUB** works.
- How services can communicate asynchronously.
- How to coordinate small, single-purpose processes.

## Project structure
```
pyzmq-playground/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.py            # Starts and supervises Detector & Reactor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detector.py                # Publishes fake detection events at random
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reactor.py                 # Subscribes & reacts to detection events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt           # pyzmq dependency
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                 # Excludes venv/ and pycache/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # This document
```

## Getting started

**Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   # or venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows PowerShell
```

**Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the Orchestrator**
```
python3 orchestrator.py
```

**You should see:**
- The Detector saying ‚Äúno detection‚Äù or ‚Äúsending 'object_detected'‚Äù
- The Reactor reacting only when an event is actually sent

```
(venv) $ python3 orchestrator.py
Orchestrator: starting Detector and Reactor services...
Detector: publishing events on tcp://*:5556
Detector: sending 'object_detected'
Reactor: waiting for events...
Detector: no detection
Detector: sending 'object_detected'
Reactor: received 'object_detected' ‚Üí reacting!
Detector: no detection
^C
Orchestrator: received Ctrl+C, shutting down...
Detector: stopped by user.

Reactor: stopped by user.
Orchestrator: all services stopped. Bye!
$
```

## [UPDATE]: New: Logging Reactor

This playground now has **two Reactors** to show how multiple services can subscribe to the same events:

- **Reactor:** Subscribes to the `object_detected` events and prints a reaction to the console.
- **LoggerReactor:** Subscribes to the same events and writes them to a log file you can watch in real-time.

**Log file path (inside the container):**
`/app/events.log`

**How to view the log file:**

Open a shell into the running container:
```bash
   docker exec -it pyzmq-playground bash
```
Tail the log file:
```tail -f /app/events.log```

You‚Äôll see timestamped detection events appear as they happen!

This shows how you can fan out the same pub/sub stream to multiple independent services with different side effects ‚Äî one for real-time actions, one for persistent logging.


## [UPDATE]: Running with Docker üê≥

This playground is fully containerized so you can run it anywhere!

### Build & run (attached mode)

From your project root:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Builds the Docker image and starts the orchestrator.
- The orchestrator runs `detector.py` and `reactor.py` inside the container.
- **Logs are shown live in the same terminal** ‚Äî thanks to Python‚Äôs unbuffered output.

Stop it anytime with `Ctrl+C` ‚Äî the orchestrator will shut down the Detector & Reactor cleanly.

### Run in the background (detached mode)

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

View logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f playground
```

Stop and remove the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

There is a helper script to do it for you.

**Note:** Always run these commands in the folder containing `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## How it works
- ZeroMQ PUB/SUB: The Detector binds a PUB socket on tcp://*:5556.
- The Reactor connects a SUB socket to tcp://localhost:5556.
- Event loop: The Detector runs forever, simulating a detection with a 30% chance every 5 seconds.
- Orchestration: The Orchestrator runs both services in separate processes and shuts them down gracefully with Ctrl+C.

---

## Next ideas

- Dockerize it [done]
- Add another Reactor that logs events to a file or database [done]
- Build a simple web dashboard to trigger and visualize detections live.
